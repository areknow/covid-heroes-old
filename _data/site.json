If you are willing to donate any of the items on this list, or if you are part of a clinic that is no longer seeing patients in the office and can donate any of these items, please contact us. If you know any hospitals or urgent care centers that can use our assistance, please have them contact us. Help us spread the word within your network so we can help as many healthcare workers as possible. If there are groups that are already providing support, please let us know. We would love to partner our efforts with you and learn from their experience. We are facing a crisis never seen before and it is up to us to help the doctors and nurses any way we can."
